# Code42 Shared Python Library
This library is written in Python 2.7 in order to make common operations easier, such as getting authentication tokens, retrieving all users in the system, or getting all devices.

## v1.7
This is the most current version of the shared library.

## v1.55
While not the most current, there are still scripts that some may find useful, and may need minor modifications to get working with the 1.7 shared library.

## legacy_pre_4.2
This folder contains scripts and the shared library version that works on Code42 on-premesis server versions prior to 4.2.  The scripts have not been tested on later server versions and may need to be updated to use later versions of the shared library.
